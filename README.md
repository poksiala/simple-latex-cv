# Panu's simple CV template

This LaTeX template can be used to create a simple but somewhat decent looking
CV. Content and styling are completely separated. All you need to do is to
fill your name and contact information in the preamble and use `\section`,
`\subsection` and `\subsubsection` for the content.

Example output in `cv.pdf`
